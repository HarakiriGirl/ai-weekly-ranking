Architecture decisions, debugging breakthroughs, and solutions I couldn't find again. There’s nothing more annoying that solving the same problem twice.I tried RAG pipelines and local vector DBs, but they added complexity for a problem that's really just text search over structured files. So I built search-sessions: a single Rust binary that searches your ",

We want them to actually interact with our files, our IDEs, and our real local workflows.But doing that right now is a security nightmare. A hallucinating (or hijacked) agent with raw system access is basically local remote code execution waiting to wipe a directory or leak an SSH key.The current workarounds are terrible:The Hardware Air-Gap: Buying a dedicated Mac Mini or a secondary cheap",

I’m trying to understand how people usually find where premium or paid features are enforced in an app. What kinds of keywords, patterns, or places in the code do experienced modders typically look for (e.g. strings, flags, checks)? Is it mostly about searching for specific words, or more about understanding app logic and flow? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46345347 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

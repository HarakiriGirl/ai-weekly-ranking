          "summary": "Each day there's a new secret word — you guess words and get a temperature score from -40° to 100° based on cosine similarity of GloVe 100d embeddings. The closer your guess is in meaning to the target, the warmer your score. Built with Nuxt 3, AWS Amplify, and ~400k word vectors stored as binary chunks in S3.

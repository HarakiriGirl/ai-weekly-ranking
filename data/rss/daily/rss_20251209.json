That helps a bit, but it still leaves huge portions of the GPU idle and introduces jitter when multiple jobs compete.We’ve come up with a different model, similar to how operating systems schedule tasks. Instead of carving up the GPU, we run multiple ML jobs inside a single shared GPU context and schedule their kernels directly. No slices, no preemption windows ",

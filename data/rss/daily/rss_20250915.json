          "summary": "Tired of your Go tests being slowed down by repetitive PostgreSQL database setup?I built pgdbtemplate to solve exactly that. It uses PostgreSQL's native template databases to create fully migrated test databases in milliseconds instead of seconds.The problem: Traditional test setup runs all your migrations for every single test. With a complex schema, this wastes minutes in every test run.The solution: Create one \"golden\" template database. Every test gets its own isolated copy instantly via CRE",

For years I’ve been frustrated by classical ERP systems being closed, rigid and expensive to change (or just not changeable at all xd).Last year I already posted my first attempt (\"PORT\", an OSS ERP), but due to better and better AI models, this approach already seemed outdated. So we iterared and today I’m sharing TNX API, an now open-source execution layer that lets AI read and write your business data, on your own server, with guardrails and logs.We w",

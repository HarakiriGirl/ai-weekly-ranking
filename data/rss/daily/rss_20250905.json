I struggled with flashcard apps that focus on decorating cards instead of learning concepts, so I built FlipCards to solve that problem.What it does: FlipCards lets you:- Create cards for any concept (math, language, coding, etc.) - Add multiple variations per card – the more variations, the better your understanding - Study smarter – the algorithm randomly selects variations so you can’t just memorize Q→A patternsWhy ",

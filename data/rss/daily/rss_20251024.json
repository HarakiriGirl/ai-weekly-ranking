          "summary": "On July 16, the European Commission proposed a €2tn seven-year budget – the largest in the EU’s history – to boost autonomy, competitiveness, and resilience. The spending plan addresses cybersecurity, innovation, and other key digital pillars, but omits a crucial component: open source. Open source software – built and maintained by communities rather than private companies alone, and free to edit and modify – is the foundation of today’s digital infrastructure. Since the 1990s, it has been ever",

Our goal is to show what you can do with local models. In the app section we will publish use cases which you can easily implement in your app. Would appreciate any feedback.Right now there is no set of proper benchmarks from us. In general we are faster than llama.cpp and on par with MLX. In a next release we will be faster than bo",

(fourtrack.fm)I spent a year building this, and about 4 months of that doing a from-scratch rewrite.It features virtual instruments and effects, sampling, re-sampling, audio recording, MIDI input. There is a piano roll for writing rhythms and melodies. There is a chart that allows you to write lyrics and arrange songs, and each part on the chart is tied to its music (e.g. verse, chorus, bridge)",

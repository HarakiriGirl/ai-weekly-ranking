Most felt clunky, hid core features like performance graphs behind a paywall, or forced a native app download. A few people close to me who take their training seriously shared the same sentiment, so I decided to build my own.I'm working on mTOR, a free, science-based workout tracker I built to automate progressive overload. It's a local-first PWA that works completely offline, syncs encrypted between your devices",

Everyone lands in the same place and can start talking in under a second.Why I made it- Forums and blog comments are great but slow; Discord/Slack feel heavy for casual drop-ins if you aren’t already a member of a community.- I wanted the simplest p",

It's my attempt to solve a problem I see in many teams: everyone is excited about AI, but its use is often seen as ineffective. As a result, many teams either don't use it or use it poorly.My core belief is that the main issue isn't the AI itself, but how we manage context. The quality of AI output is 90% dependent on the quality of the context you provide.So, I created this interactive playbook. I've built out the content for the first 4 ",

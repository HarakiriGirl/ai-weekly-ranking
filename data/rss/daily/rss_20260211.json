Rowboat is an open-source, local-first app that turns your work into a living knowledge graph (stored as plain Markdown with backlinks) and uses it to accomplish tasks on your computer.For example, you can say \"Build me a deck about our next quarter roadmap.\" Rowboat pulls priorities and commitments from your graph, loads a presentation skill, and exports a PDF",

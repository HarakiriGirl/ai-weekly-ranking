The method, called reinforcement learning pre-training (RLP), integrates RL into the initial training phase rather than saving it for the end.This approach encourages the model to “think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining,” the researchers state in their paper.

The spending plan addresses cybersecurity, innovation, and other key digital pillars, but omits a crucial component: open source.

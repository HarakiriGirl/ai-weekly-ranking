Called Markovian Thinking, the approach allows LLMs to engage in lengthy reasoning without incurring the prohibitive computational costs that currently limit such tasks.The team’s implementation, an environment named Delethink, structures the reasoning chain into fixed-size chunks, breaking the scaling problem that plagues very long LLM responses.

Other alternatives such as OSSEC, Wazuh or Elastic require heavy setup and are very time consuming. Chainsaw and Hayabusa do n",

ZigFormer is modelled after a textbook LLM (like GPT-2 from OpenAI) and can be used as a Zig library as well as a standalone application to train a model and chat with it.This was mainly an educational project.

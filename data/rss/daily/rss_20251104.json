When it emerged in the 1990s, speculation was hailed as a breakthrough — just as pipelining and superscalar execution had been in earlier decades. Each marked a generational leap in microarchitecture. By predicting the outcomes of branches and memory loads, processors could avoid stalls and keep execution units busy.

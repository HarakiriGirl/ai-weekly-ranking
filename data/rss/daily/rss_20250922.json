I'm not a huge fan of the bright loud colors in many prompts, so I configured a minimal prompt with subtle colors that fit my terminal theme.The problem is that I actually like changing my theme every now and then. And I use a different theme for my terminal app and e.g. VSCode. A single prompt config couldn't fit into everything.So I built the same prompt from scratch with Swift, and made it automatically adapt to the terminal colors",

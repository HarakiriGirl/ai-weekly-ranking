Today we’re launching Mentat (https://docs.ctgt.ai/api-reference/endpoint/chat-completions), an API that gives developers deterministic control over LLM behavior, steering reasoning and removing bias on the fly, without the compute of fine-tuning or the brittleness of prompt engineering. We use feature-level intervention and graph-based verification to fix hallucinations and enforce policies.This resonates in highly regulated industries or otherwise risky applications",

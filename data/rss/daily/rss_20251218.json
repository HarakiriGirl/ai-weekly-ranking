The spending plan addresses cybersecurity, innovation, and other key digital pillars, but omits a crucial component: open source.

Without this 'Monopoly Premium,' the US would have barely 9T in debt today. ",

I built Bob the Fixer to make “AI fixes” less vibes, more measurable.The idea: run SonarQube locally (containerized), then expose an MCP server that gives AI coding CLIs a fix-ready view of your static analysis results. Instead of “guess what to fix”, the assistant can:- scan a repo + apply quality gates - fetch rich issue details (rule info + plain-text code context) - prioritize work (tech debt / coverage gaps / duplication / patterns) - iterate: fix → test → re-scanImporta",

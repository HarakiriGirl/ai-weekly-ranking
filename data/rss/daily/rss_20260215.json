          "summary": "I packaged eMule (the ed2k/Kad P2P client from 2002) as a self-contained macOS .app using Wine Crossover. Download the .dmg, drag to Applications, run. No Wine install, no config — it auto-connects to the eMule Security server and the Kad network on first launch. Works on Apple Silicon (M1–M4) and Intel. ~480MB .dmg. The build is fully automated: a GitHub Actions workflow watches the upstream community repo (github.com/irwir/eMule) and builds a new .dmg for each release. Why? Mostly nostalgia. B",

          "summary": "Hey HN, I got frustrated with heavy proprietary sandboxes for malware analysis, so I built my own. Azazel is a single static Go binary that attaches 19 eBPF hook points to an isolated Docker container and captures everything a sample does — syscalls, file I/O, network connections, DNS, process trees — as NDJSON. It uses cgroup-based filtering so it only traces the target container, and CO-RE (BTF) so it works across kernel versions without recompilation. It also has built-in heuristics that flag",

        "summary": "Hi HN,I've spent too many nights debugging cascading failures caused by \"flapping\" circuit breakers in Node.js services. The standard tools (like Opossum) often rely on binary logic: if (error_rate > threshold) open(). This static thresholding creates a ping-pong effect where traffic is trapped in a loop.I wanted a solution that behaves like a physical damper, not a switch. So I built Atrion.It is a TypeScript implementation of a Deterministic Physics Engine designed to replace traditional circu",

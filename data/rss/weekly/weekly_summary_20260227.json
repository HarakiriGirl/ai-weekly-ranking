AetherCam is a video recording app that allows you to apply effects to the audio track in real-time. You can boost volume, add reverb, compressor, eq, and delay. Everything on the fly.The idea for AetherCam came to me when I was recording myself playing guitar and thought that the part that I came up with would sound really cool if there was some reverb applied to it.

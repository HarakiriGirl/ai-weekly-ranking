Because sarcasm, mixed tone, source credibility, and low-velocity yet high-impact stories are easy to misread, he advocates a human-in-the-loop workflow where algorithms triage the firehose and editors validate context, refine tags and summaries, and feed corrections back to the models.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://ai-weekly.ai/curating-the-curators-ted-skinner/\">Curating the Curators: How AI and Humans Collaborate to Select and Distribute News</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://ai-weekly.ai\">AI-Weekly</a>.</p>",

Leveraging decades of experience — including an early role at eWatch, one of the first online media monitoring services — he integrates Artificial Intelligence and real-time analytics into data-driven communication campaigns. His approach helps organizations sharpen their brand positioning, reduce operational blind spots, and sustain credibility in today’s dynamically shifting digital landscape.\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/tedskinner/\n.\nCurating the Curators: How AI and Humans Collaborate to Select and Distribute News\nHyper-speed media cycles and information overload are the new norm. Alongside this tidal wave, the role of curators, those who select, prioritize, and distribute news, has become mission-critical. The challenge? News doesn’t just break; it explodes. Social media, independent publishers, AI-generated content, legacy outlets… the list goes on for those that compete for attention across time zones and platforms. For public relations professionals and analysts, manually keeping up with this information firehose is no longer viable. Or is it?\nThat’s where artificial intelligence (AI) enters the equation.\nThe Promise of AI in News Curation\nArtificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), has transformed how organizations filter and analyze news. These systems ingest vast amounts of unstructured text, apply classification models, detect anomalies, and surface relevant stories far faster than human teams could.\nCore functions now automated by AI include:\nReal-time monitoring of news, blogs, and social media\nIdentification of spikes in media coverage (velocity)\nSentiment analysis and topic classification\nAutomated summaries and categorization\nThis allows organizations to detect potential crises earlier, understand narrative trajectories, and track themes across multiple geographies and formats.\nBut AI Alone Isn’t Enough\nDespite the efficiencies, AI in its current state struggles with nuance. Language is messy, and context is layered. Consider that a headline may appear neutral to a machine but signal reputational risk to a human analyst. Alternatively, a trending topic might not matter to every organization, or might matter precisely because it hasn’t reached mass awareness yet.\nHere’s A High-Level Look At The Limitations of Solely Using AI:\nNLP systems often misread sarcasm, metaphor, and cultural idioms\nSource credibility scoring can be manipulated or misweighted\nRelevance thresholds may miss low-velocity stories with high strategic importance.\nSentiment models often fail to capture irony or mixed tones.\nAI does what it’s trained to do. But the interpretive lens, what matters, to whom, and why, still requires human judgment.\nThe Case for a Human-in-the-Loop System\nThe most effective news curation workflows today don’t replace people; they support them. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems combine algorithmic speed with editorial sensibility. AI surfaces the raw material; humans refine the signal.\nA mature HITL workflow typically includes:\nInitial screening by AI, filtering thousands of articles down to a few hundred\nHuman validation and context-layering, ensuring accuracy and relevance\nRefinement of categories, sentiment tags, and narrative summaries\nFeedback loops, where analysts correct model outputs and train the system over time\nThis symbiosis improves both efficiency and precision. Analysts can focus on judgment-intensive tasks, such as interpreting tone shifts, identifying stakeholder relevance, and assessing reputational impact, while machines handle the scale and speed.\nPredictive Signals vs. Narrative Understanding\nOne promising area for AI is predictive analytics: AI models that track media velocity, engagement signals, and historical resonance to forecast which stories are likely to gain traction. These tools give teams a head start on messaging and executive visibility.\nHowever, identifying a “likely-to-trend” story still leaves the question open: Does this matter to us? That’s where domain experts, communications professionals, and strategists come in. Not all viral stories are strategic priorities. Some are just noise. Others are canaries in the coal mine.\nThe goal is not simply to chase every spike, but to anticipate which narratives carry consequence.\nFullintel: A Case Study in AI-Human Collaboration\nSeveral firms are pioneering these hybrid approaches. One example is\nFullintel\n, a media intelligence provider that blends proprietary AI (including its PredictiveAI™ system) with human editorial teams.\nTheir platform, Fullintel Hub, combines real-time machine-driven analysis with human oversight to deliver curated executive briefings, alert systems, and media performance insights. Human analysts continuously validate AI outputs, flag contextual nuances, and refine topic-level models based on client-specific needs.\nRather than treat AI as a replacement for editorial judgment, Fullintel treats it as a co-pilot, fast, tireless, and continually improving, but not infallible.\nAI as Infrastructure, Humans as Interpreters\nThe takeaway isn’t that AI will soon write tomorrow’s front page or perfect the daily news brief. It’s that AI is increasingly responsible for the infrastructure of media intelligence, speed, scale, and signal detection, while humans remain essential for interpretation.\nTogether, they can create outputs that are timely, relevant, and strategically informed.\nAI can flag a 300% spike in coverage of a specific policy change.\nA human analyst knows the organization is about to testify before Congress.\nAI generates a briefing with quotes, sentiment, and sources.\nThe human refines it for tone and context before delivery to the CEO.\nThat’s the model. Machines make it possible. People make it worthwhile.\nLooking Forward\nAs natural language models advance, AI will become better at understanding implication, humour, and regional nuance. Predictive models will improve as training data expands. Integration with workflow platforms will accelerate adoption.\nHowever, some fundamentals will remain: relevance is situational, reputation is fragile, and nuance, linguistic, political, and social, resists full automation.\nAI is not replacing human judgment in media intelligence. It’s giving it leverage.\n—\nTed Skinner\n, Vice President of Marketing,\nFullintel\nAuthor\nRecent Posts\nAI-Weekly\nThe Week's News in Artificial Intelligence\nLatest posts by AI-Weekly\n(\nsee all\n)\nCurating the Curators: How AI and Humans Collaborate to Select and Distribute News\n- August 26, 2025\nAI-Weekly for Tuesday, August 26, 2025 – Issue 179\n- August 26, 2025\nAI-Weekly for Tuesday, August 19, 2025 – Issue 178\n- August 19, 2025\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nLike this:\nLike\nLoading...\nRelated",

Study Reveals Early Signs Of Job Shifts From AI Technologies.‚Äù\n| Digitaleconomy.stanford.edu | August 26, 2025\nThis paper examines changes in the labor market for occupations exposed to generative artificial intelligence using high-frequency administrative data from the largest payroll software provider in the United States. We present six facts that characterize these shifts. We find that since the widespread adoption of generative AI, early-career workers (ages 22-25) in the most AI-exposed occupations have experienced a 13 percent relative decline in employment even after controlling for firm-level shocks. In contrast, employment for workers in less exposed fields and more experienced workers in the same occupations has remained stable or continued to grow. We also find that adjustments occur primarily through employment rather than compensation. Furthermore, employment declines are concentrated in occupations where AI is more likely to automate, rather than augment, human labor. Our results are robust to alternative explanations, such as excluding technology-related firms and excluding occupations amenable to remote work. These six facts provide early, large-scale evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the AI revolution is beginning to have a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the American labor market.\n83.)\nMelania Trump Launches Nationwide Presidential AI Challenge For Students To Promote Innovation\n| TheHill.com | August 26, 2025\nFirst lady Melania Trump is urging students across the country to ‚Äúunleash their imagination and showcase the spirit of American innovation‚Äù by participating in a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence (AI) competition.\n84.)\nAdobe Integrates Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Model Into Firefly And Adobe Express Platforms\n| Blog.adobe.com | August 26, 2025\nWith Gemini 2.5 Flash Image in the Firefly app and Adobe Express, it‚Äôs easier than ever to create amazing content and take your ideas further, faster.\n85.)\nMeta Loses Key AI Researchers As Three Recent Hires Quit New Superintelligence Lab\n| Wired.com | August 26, 2025\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg went on a recruiting blitz to lure top AI researchers to Meta.

Several experimental techniques and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, determine conformational states, binding configurations and their probabilities, but suffer from low throughput. Here we develop a Biomolecular Emulator (BioEmu), a generative deep learning system that can generate thousands of statistically independent samples from the protein structure ensemble per hour on a single graphical processing unit. By leveraging novel training methods and vast data of protein structures, over 200 milliseconds of MD simulation, and experimental protein stabilities, BioEmu’s protein ensembles represent equilibrium in a range of challenging and practically relevant metrics. Qualitatively, BioEmu samples many functionally relevant conformational changes, ranging from formation of cryptic pockets, over unfolding of specific protein regions, to large-scale domain rearrangements. Quantitatively, BioEmu samples protein conformations with relative free energy errors around 1 kcal/mol, as validated against millisecond-timescale MD simulation and experimentally-measured protein stabilities. By simultaneously emulating structural ensembles and thermodynamic properties, BioEmu reveals mechanistic insights, such as the causes for fold destabilization of mutants, and can efficiently provide experimentally-testable hypotheses.\n47.)\nOpenAI Quietly Adds Shopify As ChatGPT Shopping Search Partner\n| SearchEngineJournal.com | July 10, 2025\nOpenAI ChatGPT Search quietly expanded its shopping search features by including Shopify as a data provider.\n48.)\nxAI’s New Grok 4 Model Sets AI Benchmark Records With Enhanced Reasoning Capabilities\n| SiliconAngle.com | July 10, 2025\nElon Musk’s xAI Holdings Corp. has debuted a new large language model, Grok 4, that’s optimized for reasoning tasks such as generating code.\n49.)\nGoogle’s Flow Adds Image Speech Feature With Veo 3, Expands AI Plans To 76 More Countries\n| Blog.google | July 10, 2025\nYou can now make your images talk with Veo 3 in Flow, plus we’re expanding to more countries.
